          The Discovery phase is a process that takes place before kicking off
          project development. Discovery services offered by Cleveroad help you
          turn project requirements into a clear plan to speed up the
          development and improve the product quality. A properly conducted
          Discovery phase saves up to $200 000 on product development: it's
          considerably bigger than the price of discovery.
